# About

I am a first-year PhD student at [MIT](https://mit.edu/)'s [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), currently advised by Professor Haihao Lu. My research interests lie primarily in mathematical programming, machine learning, and their intersections (theory and algorithms). I am also exploring applications of operations research-based techniques in unconventional or innovative fields that may benefit from them.

Beyond academia, I have several passions that are very important to me, including enjoying/making music, playing instruments, singing, rock climbing (especially outdoors), traveling, and watching anime/movies. However, I am still in the process of figuring out what I truly enjoy, who I am, and what I want to become. As such, nothing on this website may fully represent my current self.
