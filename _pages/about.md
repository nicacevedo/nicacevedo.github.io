I am a first-year PhD student at MIT's Operations Research Center, advised by Professor Haihao Lu. I grew up in Chile and lived there until starting my PhD. My research focuses on mathematical programming, machine learning, and their theoretical and algorithmic intersections. I am also exploring applications of operations research-based techniques in unconventional or innovative fields that may benefit from them.

Beyond academia, I am passionate about making music, playing instruments, singing, outdoors/indoors rock climbing, traveling, and watching anime and films. However, I am still in the process of figuring out what I genuinely enjoy and what I want to become. As such, this website may not fully reflect my current self.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
