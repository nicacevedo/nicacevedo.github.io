I am a first-year PhD student at [MIT](https://mit.edu/)'s [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), advised by Professor Haihao Lu. I grew up in Chile and lived there until starting my PhD. My research focuses on mathematical programming, machine learning, and their theoretical and algorithmic intersections. I am also exploring applications of operations research-based techniques in unconventional or innovative fields that may benefit from them.


Beyond academia, I am passionate about making music, playing instruments, singing, outdoors/indoors rock climbing, traveling, and watching anime and films. However, I am still in the process of figuring out what I genuinely enjoy and what I want to become. As such, this website may not fully reflect my current self.
