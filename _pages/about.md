I am a first-year PhD student at MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/people/students/), advised by Professor [Haihao (Sean) Lu](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/hlu/). I got my undergraduate and masters degrees from the University of Chile, where I was fortunate to be advised (in different projects) by Professors [Fernando Ordonez](https://www.dii.uchile.cl/~fordon/) (Master's Thesis), [Charles Thraves](https://cthraves.com/), [Ricardo Montoya](https://economiayadministracion.uc.cl/docentes/ricardo-montoya/), and [Renaud Chicoisne](https://sites.google.com/view/renaud-chicoisne). My research focuses on mathematical programming, machine learning, and their theoretical and algorithmic intersections. I am also exploring applications of operations research-based techniques in unconventional or innovative fields that may benefit from them.

Beyond academia, I am passionate about making music, playing instruments, singing, outdoors/indoors rock climbing, traveling, and watching anime and films. However, I am still in the process of figuring out what I genuinely enjoy and what I want to become. As such, this website may not fully reflect my current self.
