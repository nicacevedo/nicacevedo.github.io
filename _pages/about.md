I am a second-year PhD student at MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/people/students/), advised by Professor [Haihao (Sean) Lu](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/hlu/). I got my undergraduate and master degrees from the University of Chile, where I was fortunate to be advised (in different projects) by Professors [Fernando Ordonez](https://www.dii.uchile.cl/~fordon/) (Master's Thesis), [Charles Thraves](https://cthraves.com/), [Ricardo Montoya](https://economiayadministracion.uc.cl/docentes/ricardo-montoya/), and [Renaud Chicoisne](https://sites.google.com/view/renaud-chicoisne). 

My research focuses on artificial intelligence and optimization. Specifically, in robust and constrained machine/deep learning models, convex/nonconvex optimization, large-scale and scalable optimization in CPU/GPU, and the applied an theoretical intersections and interactions between machine learning and optimization. I always looking for new applications of operations research-based techniques in unconventional or innovative fields that may highly benefit from them.

Beyond academia, I am passionate about making music, playing instruments, singing, rock climbing, hinking, and sports in general. Feel free to reach out to me via email at <a href="mailto:nacevedo@mit.edu">.
