Detection of outliers on standardized college admission tests. We use four methods---Mahalanobis Distance, Isolation Forest, and variations of these---to detect outliers in multivariate data. Applying PCA, the outlier metrics are combined in a single scoring for each student. Students with the highest scores are clustered with $k$-means to get interpretable groups of outliers. The methodology is performed with real data of Chilean admission test results PDT.
